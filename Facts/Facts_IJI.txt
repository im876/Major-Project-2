29. Brain tumors are the eighth-most common cancer overall among persons age 40+ years, ninth-most among males, and fifth-most among females in this age group
30. Brain tumors are the third-leading cause of cancer-related death in individuals 40 years and older
31. Gliomas (such as glioblastoma, ependymomas, astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas), which make up 81% of malignant brain tumors in adults
32. White – 16.25/100,000
33. Hispanic / Latino/a / Latinx – 15.78/100,000
34. Asian and Pacific Islander American (APIA) – 11.65/100,000
35. American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) – 10.64/100,000
36. Overall, incidence rates for all primary brain and CNS tumors are higher in females (58% of diagnoses) than in males (42%)
37. Non-malignant brain tumors occur significantly more often in females (64%) than in males (36%)
38. Malignant brain tumors occur slightly more often in males (56%) than in females (44%)
39. Incidence rates for specific brain tumor types vary, for example, glioblastoma diagnoses are more common in males, while meningioma diagnoses are more common in females
40. Overall, males have higher mortality rates from malignant brain tumors than females, with the exception of glioblastoma, embryonal tumors, and germ cell tumors
41. Not all brain tumours are cancers, some are completely benign or harmless masses of cancerous cells
42. Malignant brain cells can be cancerous cells and can spread to the other organs of the body.
43. Only two or three out of 1,00,000 people are affected accounting for less than 2% of the total number of malignancies diagnosed.
44. Overall, the chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord in his or her lifetime is less than 1%.
45. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest type of brain cancer, accounting for 45% of all malignant brain tumors.
46. A primary malignant brain tumor is a rare type of cancer accounting for only about 1.4%
47. The risk of a brain tumor increases as you age.
48. People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation
49. Cell phones aren’t proven to cause brain cancer.
50.  there is no definitive evidence that cell phone use increases the risk of cancer
51. There are different types of primary brain cancer and survival rates vary significantly depending on the type of cancer.
52. Some types of brain cancer, such as meningioma, anaplastic ependymoma and oligodendroglioma, are highly treatable
53.  Some cacer are treatable while others are less responsive to treatment.
54.  NFCR is part of a robust, international coalition working on innovative ways to defeat GBM utilizing a rigorous adaptive trial platform known as GBM
55. GBM AGILE is re-engineering the way clinical trials are conducted to develop more effective treatments faster than ever before.
56. Research  has been studying the role angiogenesis plays in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the deadliest form of brain cancer
57. new drugs that target and could extend the benefits of anti-angiogenic therapies for patients.
58. Research is identifying genes and pathways that facilitate vessel co-option in order to prevent invasion and improve GBM therapies.
59.  Dr. W.K. Alfred Yung’s research focused on drugs that target a gene called PI3K, which is a key factor in about 30% of GBM (Global Brain Tumour) cases
60. A greater inhibition of cell growth and the cancer cells were induced into cell suicide in a research
61.  Findings reveal molecular targets and designs for combination therapies that could lead to new treatments for GBM patients
62. meningioma is the most common brain tumor, accounting for about 30 percent of them.
63. Meningioma tumors are often benign: You may not even need surgery.
64. A meningioma diagnosis may occur when the doctor is looking for something else
65. When a doctor diagnoses a meningioma, you will get further tests to find out how the tumor is likely to behave
66. a neurosurgeon will recommend removing the tumor or just watching it to see if it grows
67.  tumor cells are not likely to spread to other parts of the body.
68. meningiomas can quietly grow for years without causing any problems — and they can get surprisingly large.
69. Sometimes, believe it or not, your doctor may recommend observation for meningioma, especially if it’s small and not causing problems.
70. You’ll have regular MRIs to check on small detections of bain tumour
71.  Depending on where the tumor is, each approach will be different
72. umors close to the surface are typically easier to access than those located along the skull base.
73. Skull base tumors are those located deep in the skull, behind the nose or eyes and call for surgeons with skill and expertise in this kind of surgery
74. There are a number of new techniques in brain tumor surgery, even for tumors located deep in the skull, and some of these are less invasive.
